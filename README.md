# Fuel Watcher
### A basic web scraper which will let you scrape ```https://www.fuelwatch.wa.gov.au/``` and returns the best priced fuel.

#### Sample usage   
This is still super new (ie. 50 lines of code new). Right now, you just call it like:
``` FuelPrice(suburb="Balcatta",brand="7-Eleven").print_all()```
